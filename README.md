# üéÆ Pixels Game Automation Bot

## Description
This repository contains a Python script for automating actions in the Pixels game. The bot utilizes computer vision techniques for image detection and automation using OpenCV, PyAutoGUI, and threading. It continuously scans the screen for specific images related to collecting and crafting in the game and performs corresponding actions automatically.

## Features
- **Automated Collecting:** üõ†Ô∏è The bot detects and collects resources in the game.
- **Crafting Automation:** üè≠ It also automates crafting by detecting crafting options and performing necessary actions.
- **User Interface:** üñ•Ô∏è Includes a simple GUI built with Tkinter for easy interaction and control.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (`cv2`)
- NumPy (`numpy`)
- PyAutoGUI (`pyautogui`)
- Tkinter (`tkinter`)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/aymane67/Pixels-Game-Bot.git
    ```
2. Install dependencies:
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
1. Run the bot:
    ```
    python pixels_game_bot.py
    ```
2. Click the "Start" button to begin automation.
3. To pause automation, click the "Stop" button. Click "Start" again to resume.
4. Close the application window to exit.

## Customization
- **Images:** Replace the image files for collecting and crafting with the relevant images from your game.
- **Threshold:** Adjust the threshold value (`0.8` by default) in the code for template matching to improve detection accuracy.
